function omega_en_n = transport_rate(lat, Vn, Ve, h)
% transport_rate: calculates the transport rate in the navigation frame.
%
% INPUT
%	lat, 1x1 latitude (rad).
%	Vn, 1x1 North velocity (m/s).
%   Ve, 1x1 East velocity (m/s).
%   h, altitude (m).
%
% OUTPUT
%	omega_en_n, 3x1 transport rate (rad/s).
